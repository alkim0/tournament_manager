<h2>Creating brackets for {{division_name}} division</h2>
<p>Below are the seedings for all teams. In order to create a bracket, the following conditions must be met:
  <ul>
    <li>
    All seed numbers must be either blank or greater than zero.
    </li>
    <li>
    All seed numbers which are not blank must be unique.
    </li>
  </ul>
If a team is not assigned a seed, it will not be placed into the bracket. It can be added manually afterward.
</p>
